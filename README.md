# **ðŸ”Ž AI Startup Analysis Tool**

This project provides an end-to-end solution for analyzing AI startups and generating comprehensive reports, including SWOT analysis and visualizations. The project is structured into four agents, orchestrated to work together seamlessly.

---

## **Features**
- **Data Aggregation**: The research agent aggregates data from multiple sources.
- **SWOT Analysis**: The analysis agent performs a detailed SWOT and sentiment analysis.
- **Visualization**: The visualization agent generates insightful charts.
- **Report Generation**: The report agent compiles findings into a structured PDF report.

## Introduction
This is a description of the project.

### **Agents**
1. **Research Agent**:
   - Aggregates data and summarizes it for further analysis.
   - Tool: `DuckDuckGoSearchTool`.

2. **Analysis Agent**:
   - Performs SWOT and sentiment analysis on aggregated data.

3. **Visualization Agent**:
   - Processes analysis results and generates visualizations (e.g., bar charts).

4. **Report Agent**:
   - Combines all results into a structured, downloadable PDF report.

### **Orchestrator**
The orchestrator coordinates all agents to execute the workflow in the following sequence:
1. Aggregate data using the research agent.
2. Perform SWOT and sentiment analysis using the analysis agent.
3. Generate visualizations using the visualization agent.
4. Compile a PDF report using the report agent.

## Technical Overview
Core Scripts
- hf_api_model.py: Loads and initializes the shared Hugging Face model for CPU inference.
- research_agent.py: Implements the research agent to aggregate data.
- analysis_agent.py: Implements the analysis agent to perform SWOT and sentiment analysis.
- visualization_agent.py: Implements the visualization agent for generating charts.
- report_agent.py: Implements the report agent to compile results into a PDF.
- orchestrator.py: Coordinates all agents to execute the workflow.
- gradio_interface.py: Provides a Gradio-based user interface.
## Model
The application uses the groq llama 3.2 1b preview model. The model is loaded with optimizations for CPU inference and low memory usage.

## Example Workflow
**Input:**
Topic: "AI startups in healthcare from 2020-2025".
## Workflow:
- The research agent aggregates data about the startups.
- The analysis agent identifies strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT).
- The visualization agent creates charts for SWOT results.
- The report agent compiles all data into a PDF report.



**Output:**
A downloadable PDF report with detailed findings.
